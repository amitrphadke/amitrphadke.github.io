Hi, I’m Amit Phadke working as an SRE / Platform engineer / DEVOPS architect at CISCO.  I have travelled to mulitple countries like Australia / Germany / Belgium and worked extentensively at client locations. 

Previously I have worked for multiple clients as a developer / tech lead / architect in diffrent domain like BFSI, Retail, Telecom and Manufacturing. There I was mostly responsible for the development and managment of the system, which uses different technologies / tools like DEVOPS , .net, sharepoint, cloud etc. 

These days, I mostly do work around DEVOPS/Kubernetes/Helm/Jenkins/Prometheus/IAC and the like.

In my free time, I like to make saw dust with woodworking tools having chord and without. I build wooden furnitrue/machines by making its 3D design using CAD tools like sketchup.
